      "🤖 Orchestrator is processing...\n",
      "Final: That's a fantastic question. Here's what science tells us is happening in your brain when you meditate:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. The \"Me Center\" Quiets Down:** You have a brain network called the Default Mode Network (DMN) that's active when your mind wanders or thinks about yourself. Meditation helps to decrease activity in this area, which is linked to a reduction in worry and self-centered thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. The \"Assessment Center\" Shrinks:** The amygdala, your brain's fear and anxiety hub, has been shown to decrease in gray matter density with regular meditation. This means your \"fight or flight\" response becomes less reactive, and you're less likely to be overwhelmed by stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. The \"Executive Center\" Gets Stronger:** The prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for focus, concentration, and decision-making, actually thickens. This helps you to better regulate your emotions and be more mindful in your daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. The \"Memory & Emotion\" Center Grows:** The hippocampus, which is vital for learning, memory, and emotional regulation, shows an increase in gray matter. This helps with resilience and your ability to manage stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, meditation is like a workout for your brain. It strengthens the areas associated with focus and calmness while reducing the reactivity of the areas linked to stress and anxiety. It’s a powerful way to reshape your brain for the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "👤 User: I'm feeling super stressed before my exam. Can you help me relax?\n",
      "🤖 Orchestrator is processing...\n",
      "Final: Of course. It's completely normal to feel stressed before an exam, and taking a few moments to relax can make a big difference. I can guide you through a technique to help calm your mind and body.\n",
